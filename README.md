# TabbedPageIssue

To demonstrate an issue with TabbedPage

Run the project.
Click the "Open Tabbed Page" button
A tabbed page opens, with two pages - Page 1 and Page 2.
Page 1 is displayed (no content in this example though), and the bar is under Page 1 to highlight it is the current page.
Click Page 2, the bar will correctly disappear from under Page 1 and appear under Page 2.
Click the Back button to close the page.
Click the "Open Tabbed Page" button.
Now both Page 1 and Page 2 titles have bars under them! In fact only Page 1 is shown, and therefore only Page 1 should have the bar under it!
